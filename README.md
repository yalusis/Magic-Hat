# Magic-Hat
This mobile application, built with React Native and TypeScript, is a fun guessing game where players identify which Hogwarts house a character belongs to. The app features three main screens:

Home Screen: Here, players guess the Hogwarts house of a given character.
List Screen: Displays all previously guessed and unguessed characters. Users can filter characters for easier searching and return to previously guessed characters by pressing the reload button.
Details Screen: Provides detailed information about a character. Note that information is only accessible after the character has been correctly guessed.
Explore the magical world of Harry Potter and test your knowledge of Hogwarts houses!
